**Instructions to add/remove songs**

- To add a new song, head over to index.html, navigate for class "playlists" inside "rightbox" class.
- This div contains all the songs by "playlist-card-containor" classes. 
- To add a new song at any position, copy any "playlist-card-containor" and paste it at desired position.
- Now add a cover image in ./img/cover and audio file at ./songs
- **Remeber to SAVE THE AUDIO FILE AS JUST THE NAME OF SONG AS IN CARD CONTAINOR OF THAT SONG, for eg: artist - song1.mp3 is the audio file, rename it as song1.**
- Its because the Js code takes the song title from card of clicked song, adds the name in ./songs/${song-name}.mp3 form and searches for song in ./songs.
- To remove a song, just remove its "playlist-card-containor".
